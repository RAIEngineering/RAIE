title: Special Issue on Responsible AI Engineering - ITAI
---

***A special issue with [IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence](https://cis.ieee.org/publications/ieee-transactions-on-artificial-intelligence/)***

### Theme & Goals

The recent release of ChatGPT has drawn huge global attention. The black box nature and the rapid advancements in super-intelligence of AI have sparked significant concerns about responsible AI. It is crucial to ensure that the AI systems are developed and used responsibly throughout their entire lifecycle and trusted by humans who are expected to use them and rely on them. To achieve this, a number of AI ethics principles have been published, which AI systems should conform to. However, high-level AI ethics principles are far from ensuring responsible AI systems. There is a significant gap between high-level AI ethics principles and low-level concrete practice for practitioners. Responsible AI challenges can occur at any stage of the AI system development lifecycle, crosscutting AI components, non-AI components, and data components of systems. To tackle the responsible AI challenges, in this special issue, we are looking for cutting edge technologies, novel studies, and promising developments, which can help to inform the community of stakeholders of available actionable approaches to the responsible engineering of AI systems.

### Topics of Interest

Topics of interests include, but are not limited to:

- Requirement engineering for responsible AI
- Software architecture and design of responsible AI systems
- Verification and validation for responsible AI systems
- DevOps, AIOps, MLOps for responsible AI systems
- Development processes for responsible AI systems
