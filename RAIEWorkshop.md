***1st International Workshop on Software Engineering for Responsible AI (SE4RAI'22)***

Co-located with [**ICSE 2022**](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2022)

Virtual

May 21-29, 2022

### Theme & Goals

Artificial intelligence (AI) continues demonstrating its positive impact on society and successful adoptions in data rich domains. The global AI market was valued at USD 62.35 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow with an annual growth rate of 40.2% from 2021 to 2028. Although AI is solving real-world challenges and transforming industries, there are serious concerns about its ability to behave and make decisions in a responsible way touching on lives and human values. Responsible AI is one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time and societies.

In recent years, many ethical regulations, principles and guidelines for responsible AI have been issued by governments, research organisations, and enterprises. However, these principles are typically very high level and do not provide concrete guidance to technologists on how to implement AI responsibly. For example, one of the principles in the Australian AI Ethics Framework is that AI systems should respect “human-centred values”, but this leaves unanswered many questions such as which values, and how can these values be designed for, implemented and tracked in an AI system. Developing responsible AI systems goes beyond fixing traditional software code "bugs" and providing theoretical guarantees for algorithms. New and improved software engineering approaches are required to ensure that the AI systems developed are trustworthy throughout the entire lifecycle and trusted by those who use and rely on them. 

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners in software engineering and AI to build up a community that will target the software engineering challenges that developers and technologists are facing in developing AI systems responsibly. In this workshop, we are looking for cutting-edge software engineering methods, techniques, tools and real-world case studies that can help operationalise responsible AI.

### Topics of Interest

Topics of interests include, but are not limited to:

• Requirement engineering for responsible AI

• Software architecture and design of responsible AI systems

• Verification and validation for responsible AI systems

• DevOps, AIOps, MLOps for responsible AI systems

• Development processes for responsible AI systems

• Governance of responsible AI

• Software engineering for explainable AI

• Reproducibility and traceability of AI

• Trust and trustworthiness of AI systems

• Human-centric AI systems and human values in AI systems

**Two types of contributions will be considered:**

1. A research or experience full paper with 8 pages max. Papers describing the challenges, starting results, vision papers, or the experience papers from or in cooperation with the practitioners are encouraged.

2. A short research or experience paper with 4 pages max. The same topics as for long papers.

**Selected papers presented at the workshop will be invited to consider submission (after significant extension) for the IEEE flagship magazine - [IEEE Computer special issue on software engineering for responsible AI](https://www.computer.org/digital-library/magazines/co/call-for-papers-special-issue-on-software-engineering-for-responsible-ai)**

### Submission Guidelines

• Submissions must conform to the [ACM conference paper formatting instructions](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2022. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

• LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., {\documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}), and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments.

• All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program committee. Please note, the submissions should NOT be double blind, i.e. in the submission the authors should be specified. All workshop papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through the [EasyChair workshop website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=se4rai22).

• All submissions must be in PDF.
